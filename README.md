**Breakout**
*This will be my project for the 4th marking period in my engineering class. Breakout is a game that consists in rows of bricks with about 10 each. I will try my best to make it look nice, colorful, and fun. The game's goal is to break all the bricks without letting the ball fall. The player controls the bar and guides the ball to whatever brick/bricks, he/she wants to break. The game will give notifications whether you won or lost; it will recognize the outcome of each play. Also, as the game goes, the ball will be getting faster and faster making the game a little bit harder. Kivy will be my basis in this project. By using Kivy, the player will be able to interact directly with the screen and be able to enojy the game. I hope the outcome of this project is positive and LET'S WORK! :)*
